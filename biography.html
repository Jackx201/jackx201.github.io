									<h2>Biography</h2>
									<p>Who am I?</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									My name is Zahúl Guadalupe Domínguez Chávez, I was born in Gomez Palacio Durango, México, September 24th of 2000. 
									I was raised in a humble neighborhood by my beloved parents, alongside my older brother until I was 12 years old, 
									when we had to move to Lerdo, Durango. My home was in the middle of nowhere, there were only 2 functional houses 
									by that time, hence, I didn’t have the chance to socialize with other people, being computers and videogames my 
									only option.  
								</p>

										<h3>How it all started  </h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										A computer enthusiasm since my early years, I grew up surrounded by videogames and computers, which gave me 
										the dream of creating my own videogames and make people happy, just as my favorite videogame characters made 
										me happy in my humble room when I was a little kid. I’m glad I can tell I’m living this dream right now, and 
										I’ll be really happy to share and live this beautiful dream alongside other people as passionate as me. Even  if
										 we are not creating videogames, I have a strong respect for the Digital world and the creations that it has seen.
									</p>
									<p>
										Videogames are my specialty; however, I have a considerable amount of experience when it comes to Software development. 
										I started as a web developer, learning how to give use to HTML, CSS and JavaScript, allowing to create my first website, 
										where I talked about videogames and other media. Eventually I found PHP and I decided to give it a try, the first times 
										were sort of complicated, but I managed to create a website for sharing and creating forums, the only problem is that it 
										only worked on my local network, since internet protocols were completely beyond my knowledge. After learning how websites 
										worked, I decided to give a faith jump to videogames development, that’s when I stumbled on the C# programming language 
										and the .NET framework, I tried to create a few games using Visual Studio, at least until I realized there were other 
										tools that were way more efficient for developing videogames, finding Unity as my first option for being already 
										familiarized with the C# programming language.
									</p>

										<h3>What am I currently into?</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										I’m currently learning mobile app development, to be more specific, mobile app development with Flutter, based on 
										the programming language: “Dart”, using Android Studio as my code editor. I am also learning how to use in depth some 
										frameworks, such as Node JS, Angular JS, Laravel and React. Videogame development is my main activity now, I keep improving
										 my skills on Unity and C# programming, as well as polishing my artistic abilities in 3D modeling, and web design.
